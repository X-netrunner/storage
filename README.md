-- This project is for my use. --

I wanted to store important commands or codes that might get deleted from my computer in the long run. Why don't I store them in a cloud? Well, it's fun to make a website so yeah.
If you like please go through the codes, they are very inefficient and terrible tbh right now as I just started to code. If you do edit them to fix the errors or make it better please do message me, I would love to learn more.

please do contact me either by :
